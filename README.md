# Intro

This tutorial aims at showing how eager execution, scripting and tracing can be
implemented. The code might be not ideal, but hopefully it still shows the main
components of the design and how different moving parts work together.

The tutorial includes following chapters:

 1. Implementing eager mode execution
 2. Introducing IR and implementing scripted mode
 3. Adding tracing
 4. Optimization example on IR
 5. Caching (aka Specialization)
